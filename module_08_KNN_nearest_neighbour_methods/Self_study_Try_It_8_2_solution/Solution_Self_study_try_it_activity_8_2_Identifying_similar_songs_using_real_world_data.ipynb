Then, you'll apply the KNN algorithm to the data set to recommend songs that are similar to a selected list based on these features.\n",

This data set is a large-scale, structured and feature-rich data set of music tracks from Spotify that is designed primarily for data analysis, machine learning and recommendation system development. It provides both metadata and detailed audio features for each track in a convenient CSV format, making it accessible for a wide range of music data science applications\n",
