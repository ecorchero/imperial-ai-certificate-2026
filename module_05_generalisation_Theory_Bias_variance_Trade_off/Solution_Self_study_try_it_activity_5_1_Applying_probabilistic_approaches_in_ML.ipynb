    "Laplace's rule of succession differs from other estimation methods in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In MLE, the binomial probability parameter θ is $s/n$, while in Laplace's rule of succession, it is: $$ \\theta = \\frac{s+1}{n+2}$$ This is to avoid the extreme probability of 0 and 1 while using Laplace's rule of succession.\n",

    "2. MLE represents a frequentist approach that only considers the observed data, whereas Laplace's rule represents a Bayesian approach that incorporates prior beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For small samples, Laplace's rule provides reasonable estimates. However, if the sample size increases, both methods converge to $s/n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MLE ($s/n$) is simpler and more widely used in frequentist statistics, whereas Laplace's rule is better for cases that involve a small sample size, where zero probability would be problematic or where the Bayesian approach is preferred."
